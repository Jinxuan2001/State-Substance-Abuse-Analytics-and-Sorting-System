# State-Substance-Abuse-Analytics-and-Sorting-System
COP3530_Project3_Group81

Problem: 
Substance abuse among various age groups presents a significant challenge to society, one that is made apparent through lack of awareness and knowledge on the pressing issue. There are not enough resources dedicated to research engines specializing in substance abuse in each state.

Motivation: 
This expanding issue is pulled forth by the lack of adequate knowledge and societal stigmas surrounding addiction. Researchers should have access to engines that display such data in a sorted and efficient manner in order to motivate destigmatization and informational initiatives. Substance abuse has consequences that extend to all sectors of society, such as increasing physical and mental health disorders, strained medical resources, lost productivity, and exacerbating behavioral issues among youth. The addressment of this issue is imperative to find necessary prevention and treatments.

Features: 
The console presents three categories to choose from: State Substance Abuse Number; State Substance Abuse Rate; Worst Drug Type. Thereafter, the user chooses from quick sort or heap sort to sort highest to lowest of numbers and rates. This program visualizes the differences in substance abuse in each state which can be utilized in researching state policies or campaigns effective in combating the scourge of substance abuse. Furthermore, the time it takes to complete each sorting algorithm is displayed in order to compare the efficiency of each algorithm when using a specific dataset. After visualizing the data set, we can clearly see the ratio of different substance abuse among certain populations, and have an awareness of how serious substance abuse happens among people of different ages.

Description of Data: 
The data used and presented is the total number of substance abuse, the rate of substance abuse, and the worst type of abuse categorized by each state in 2018. The number of abuse is in the thousands of people per unit.

Drugs CSV File: https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/drugs/ 

Tools/Languages/APIs?Libraries used: Visual Studio, C++, limits library, algorithm library, chrono library

Algorithms Implemented: Quick sort and Heap sort are used for sorting the states by the total number/rate of substance abuse

Additional Data Structures/Algorithms Used: Merge sort is used for sorting different types of substance abuse in each state
